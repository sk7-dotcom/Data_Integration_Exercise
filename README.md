Welcome to the second tutorial for Biology 722! 

We are going to be spending this lesson:

1. Introducing **Streptomyces Venezuelae** and the biological question we want to answer today.
2. Discussing the ChIP-seq analysis pipeline and how integrating these results into the RNA-seq data can give greater biological clarity to data. 
3. Workshop on ChIP-seq pipeline and integration.
4. Results and Discussion on biological question.
